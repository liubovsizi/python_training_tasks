#A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.



class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:
        string_for_check = ''.join([c for c in s.lower() if c.isalnum()])
        return string_for_check == string_for_check [::-1]
